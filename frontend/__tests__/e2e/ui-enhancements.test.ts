/*
 * E2E Test Scenarios for UI Enhancements:
 *
 * 1. Drag-and-Drop Task Reordering:
 *   - User can drag a task card from one position to another
 *   - The task order is visually updated immediately
 *   - The backend receives the updated order
 *   - The new order persists after page refresh
 *
 * 2. Enhanced Micro-Interactions:
 *   - Buttons have hover effects
 *   - Task cards have entrance animations
 *   - Completion/deletion has visual feedback
 *   - Page transitions are smooth
 *
 * 3. Calendar View:
 *   - User can switch from list view to calendar view
 *   - Tasks with due dates appear in the calendar
 *   - User can navigate between months
 *   - User can create tasks from the calendar view
 *   - Filtering works in both views
 *
 * 4. Accessibility Features:
 *   - Keyboard navigation works for all features
 *   - Screen readers announce drag operations
 *   - Focus indicators are visible
 *   - ARIA labels are properly set
 *
 * 5. Performance:
 *   - Large task lists render efficiently
 *   - Calendar view performs well with many tasks
 *   - Animations remain smooth
