# Dashboard Welcome Message Clarification

## Summary
Clarified the welcome message behavior on the dashboard to differentiate between new and returning users.

@specs/dashboard-fixes/spec.md ek or issue ha user first time signup kr k  dashboard pr arha usko bhi welcome back ka msg arha top pr heading me usy just welcome ana chahiye na or jo user login kr k aye old usko welcome back ka

## Response
Updated the dashboard specification to clarify that the welcome message should be differentiated:
- "Welcome" for first-time users (new signups)
- "Welcome back" for returning users (existing users logging in)

The specification was updated to include this clarification in both the header section description and a new clarifications section.
